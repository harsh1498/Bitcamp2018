## PUDUI Project for Bitcamp 2018

PUDUI is a django web application reunite patients, doctors, and the insurance company once again. We want to bring back a time when the doctor and the patient were able to communicate without intermediates in between. We used to be able to call our doctor on their phone and they would answer, not their assistant, and they would talk to you about your symptoms over the phone and give you advice.
